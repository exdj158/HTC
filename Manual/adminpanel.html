</ul>
<br/><h3 id="aboutadminpanel">About Admin Panel:</h3>
<p>
The Admin panel provides a user-friendly web user interface to setup folders for users. 
Information about assigned folders is stored in the <b>Data\Folders.xml</b> file. 
You can modify this file <a href="manualfolders.html">manually</a> with a text editor.
Also you can <a href="sourcecode.html">programmatically setup users and groups</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To run Admin panel:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>User should be an HTTP Commander Administrator, i.e his/her name should be listed in the <strong>Administrators</strong> key at <a href="webconfigsetup.html#Administrators">Application settings</a></li>
  <li>Check that Read and Modify <a href="ntfs.html">NTFS permissions</a> for Data\ folder are set correctly.</li>
  <li>Open <b>"/HTCOMNET/AdminPanel.aspx"</b> in a browser or click <b>Administration</b> button on the toolbar of the main interface.</li>
</ul>




<br/><h3 id="foldersetup">How to setup folders using the Admin panel:</h3>

 <ul>
 <li>Open the <b>"Folders"</b> tab and click <b>"Add folder..."</b> to create a new folder, 
    or <b>"Edit folder..."</b> to edit an existing one.</li>
 <li>In the new window you can type a folder name (alias), a full path and manage the access for users to this folder:
   <ul>
	<li>Insert an alias for the folder in the <b>"Folder name"</b> field, 
	e.g. "My personal folder" or "Students shared", etc. 
	<p><b>Note</b> You cannot use alias <b>"root"</b> for technical reasons.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Insert the full path to the folder in &quot;Physical path&quot; field. It can be a local path (e.g. 'c:\myfolder') , remote folder on a server (UNC format like \\MyServer\filesharename\directoryname) or DFS folder (like \\domain\DFSfolder).<br/>
	You can use the following patterns in the folder path:
	  <ul>
	    <li><b>%USERNAME%</b> or <b>%LOGONUSER%</b> - the pattern will be replaced by the user's logon name. For example, if you create "c:\personalfolders\%USERNAME%" for "jdoe" user, the path will be "c:\personalfolders\jdoe" when 'jdoe' logons into the HTTP Commander. </li>
	    <li><b>%GROUPNAME%</b> - the pattern will be replaced by the logon user's group name. For example, if you create "c:\%GROUPNAME%\%USERNAME%" for "Mike" user from  "Students" group,  the path will be "c:\Students\Mike&quot;. </li>
		<li><b>%USERNAME_SUBSTRN_L%</b> - the pattern will be replaced by a substring of the user's logon name. N is start index (starting at 1), L is length of substring. For example, <b>%USERNAME_SUBSTR1_1%  </b>for Mike user will be &quot;M&quot;. </li> 
		<li><b>%GROUPNAME_SUBSTRN_L%</b> - the same as above but for the group name. </li> 
	    <!-- For windows version only. Start --> 
	    <li><b>%HOME%</b> - The pattern will be replaced by the user's Active Directory home folder's path. <b>Note!</b> For greater perfomance use %USERNAME% (or %LOGONUSER%) pattern instead of %HOME% if it is possible.	    </li>
	    <!-- For windows version only. End --> 
	    </ul>
		<b>Note!</b> Don't share folders inside the application root folder 
		(deleting some files and folders in the application folders restarts the application).</li>
   </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Now you need to specify users and groups who can have access to the created folder:
   <ul>
 <li>Click the <b>"Add user..."</b> button to provide access for a single user, 
    or <b>"Add group..."</b> to provide access for a group of users.</li>
 <li>
   <p>In the user/group selection dialogue, enter a user/group name or select the name from the list,
   for example, jdoe or Students2009.
   When HTTP Commander is configured to use Windows accounts, 
   we recommend that you specify a fully qualified user/group name with domain part.
   For example, YOURDOMAIN\Students2009 or jdoe@YOURDOMAIN.
   See <a href="ActiveDirectory.html">Active Directory integration</a> for complete list of supported
   account name formats.</p>
   <p>Here you can also use a <b>regular expression</b>:</p>
 Insert "regex:"  in the beginning of the line if you want to use regular expression.<br/>
 Example 1:  <code>regex:^(jdoe|Mike)$</code> - this regular expression   means two users: jdoe and Mike.<br/>
 Example 2:  <code>regex:Students</code> - this regular expression means all groups with "Students" in their names, e.g. "Students2008", "Students2009",  etc. </li>
 <li>If you want to <b>provide access for any user</b>, you need to type <code>regex:.*</code> - this  regular expression means  any user name. </li>
 </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After the users or groups are specified, you need to configure permissions to the folder for selected users and groups.
  There are two layers of access control that determine the set of allowed operations with the file system.
  <ol>
    <li>NTFS permissions (provided the file system is hosted on NTFS volume) applies to a Windows security principal.</li>
    <li>HTTP Commander permissions specify what operations are allowed in the application.</li>
  </ol>
  <!-- For windows version only. Start --> 
  In most cases  NTFS permissions are already set for the folders for your users and groups. 
  There is no need to modify the existing NTFS permissions. 
  The application impersonates the logged on user before performing operations with file system. 
  A user won't have access to files if it is prohibited by NTFS permissions.
  <!-- For windows version only. End -->
  <p>To configure HTTP Commander permissions...</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Select a user or a group name in the list.</li>
  <li>Set necessary permissions on the right panel.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click the "Save" button to save changes.</li>
  <li>The user should logoff and logon again to view new created folders.</li>
  <li>Extra parameters: You can type <strong>"Limitations"</strong> for the folder-this is text that will be shown for users at the most visible place. 
  There is also a <strong>"Description"</strong> field - it is text that will be shown for users in the left tree.</li>
 </ul>

<h3 id="quota">Manage Quotas</h3>
<p>HTTP Commander allows you to manage quotas on folders. 
You may query existing quotas and create new ones.
Quotas are powered by File Server Resource Manager.
File Server Resource Manager is available for <a target="_blank" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755603(v=ws.10)">Windows Server 2003 R2</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732431(v=ws.10)">Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2</a>,

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/windows-server/windows-server-2012-r2.aspx">Windows Server 2012 R2</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-technical-preview">Windows Server 2016</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Supported OSs</strong>: Windows Servers 2003 R2, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, 2016.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites for managing quotas on local folders</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> A local folder is any folder located on the hard disk on the web server where HTTP Commander is installed.
For example, "c:\HttpRootFolder".</p>
<ul>
<li>
    File Server Resource Manager is installed on the web server machine.
    <br />
    <a target="_blank" href="Images/FileServerResourceManagerRole.png" onclick="toggleBlock('FileServerResourceManagerRole'); return false;"
       class="imglink">Screenshot</a>
    <div id="FileServerResourceManagerRole" style="display: none;">
        <p class="screenshot">
            &nbsp;<img src="Images/FileServerResourceManagerRole.png" />
        </p>
    </div>
</li>
<li>Administrative rights to the web server machine.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prerequisites for managing quotas on network folders</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> A network folder is any folder specified with UNC paths.
For example, "\\server-name\shared\dir1". </p>
<ul>
<li>Successful resolution of network path.<br/>
In other words, ability to detect the server and folder hosting the data.
For example, the network path "\\server-name\shared\dir1" may be resolved to folder "C:\shared" on server "server-name".
<p>HTTP Commander supports paths of conventional shared folders and DFS paths.</p>

<p>If the network path specifies a conventional shared folder, you need administrative rights to the server hosting this folder.
For the network path "\\server\share\dir1", you need administrative rights to server "server".
</p>

<p>If the network path is a DFS path, you need administrative rights to the root DFS server if this is a stand-alone DFS namespace,
and to Domain controller if this is a domain-based DFS namespace.
In stand-alone case, information about the DFS namespace is stored in the registry of the root server.
In domain-based case, information about the DFS namespace is stored in Active Directory.
After resolving the DFS path you get another network path that should be resolved.
The DFS link may point to another DFS path or to a conventional shared folder.
The resolution process continues until HTTP Commander finds the target server and folder hosting the data.
</p>

</li>
<li>File Server Resource Manager is installed on the web server machine.</li>
<li>File Server Resource Manager is installed on the target machine. 
The target machine is detected in the process of resolving the path.</li>
<li>
    <p>The web server and the target machine must have identical versions of File Server Resource Manager.
    There are two incompatible versions of FSRM:</p> 
    <ul>
    <li>1) installed on Windows Server 2003 R2;</li>
    <li>2) installed on Windows Servers 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, 2016.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, you cannot manage quotas on Windows Server 2008 from web server running Windows Server 2003 R2.
</p>
</li>
<li>Administrative rights to the target machine.
</li>
<li>No firewalls blocking remote procedure call (RPC) ports used by DFS and the DFS root server that hosts DFS.
This condition should be fulfilled for all DFS root servers and DFS hosts discovered in the course of path resolution.
See <a target="_blank" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/es-es/library/cc782417(v=ws.10).aspx#w2k3tr_dfs_how_gndl">Network Ports Used by DFS</a> for details.
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note about administrative rights to remote machine</strong> 
In the process of resolving the network path and for managing quotas on remote server,
you are required to have administrative rights to the remote machine.
In the case when both machines (the web server and the remote machine) are Windows Server 2003 (R2),
machines may be members of network group or joined to domain.
If one of the machines is Windows Server 2008 (R2), Windows Server 2012 (R2) or 2016, 
then both machines must be joined to the same domain or trusted domains.
</p>

<p><strong>Limitations</strong> HTTP Commander follows only first target of DFS link
and DFS root.</p>

<!-- For windows version only. End --> 
 
 
 <h3 id="filter">Filter</h3>
 
 <p>
    HTTP Commander allows to specify a filter to express additional restrictions on the set of users 
    whom the specific folder is assigned. 
    This filter applies in addition to ACL (the list of users and groups that are allowed access) and 
    can express complex conditions. The syntax of the filter is similar to the syntax of LDAP queries.
 </p>
 
 <p>
    An elementary filter looks like this:
 </p>
 <p>
    <b>(attribute = "value")</b>,
 </p>
 <p>
    where <b>attribute</b> is either <b>user</b> or <b>group</b>,
    <b>value</b> - the value of the attribute.
    The attribute value may contain substitution characters: <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>.
 </p>
 <p>
    Note, brackets and quotes are mandatory. Comparison is case-insensitive.
 </p>
 <p>
    To create a complex filter, individual components are composed into a filter list using logical
    AND (<b>&amp;</b>), OR (<b>|</b>), NOT (<b>!</b>) operations.
    For example, 
    <b>(&amp;(|(user="user*")(user="Admin"))(!(group="group1")))</b>.
    This filter matches a user with the name "Admin" and users whose names begin on "user",
    that are not members of the "group1" group.
 </p>
 <p>
    For validate syntax of the filter entered by you, it is used the link <b>Validate</b> to left side of a field.

<h3 id="gpolfolders">Group Policy Drive Maps</h3>

<p>
If you use  
<a target="_blank" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731729.aspx">Group Policy Drive Maps Extension</a>, 
you can import Drive Maps as HTTP Commander folders.
</p>
<p>
On the <b>Misc</b> tab of Admin Panel you can import folders manually. 
You need to specify a data source &mdash; from where to load Drive Maps.
You have two options: Domain Controller ("From DC" option) 
or XML file ("From file" option). When you select "Domain Controller", you need to 
specify DNS name, NetBIOS name, or IP Address of the domain controller in 
the "Computer name" field. Leave the field blank to use the domain controller
of the domain of the current user of HTTP Commander. 
When you select "XML file", you need to specify the path to the Drives.xml file 
containing all required settings. Note, the path is interpreted on the Web Server,
not on the client that runs the web browser.
</p>
<p>
The Drives.xml file is located at the following path on domain controllers
</p>
<p>
<b>\\&lt;doman controller&gt;\sysvol\&lt;domain name&gt;\Policies\&lt;GUID&gt;\USER\Preferences\Drives\Drives.xml</b>,
</p>
<p>where domain controller &mdash; is a DNS name, a NetBIOS name or an IP address of the domain controller. 
There may be a number of Drives.xml files on the domain controller, one for each GPO.
</p>

<p>The import utility loads all folders from the domain controller or XML file
and matches them against the list of folders configured in HTTP Commander.
Existing folders are updated, new folders are added.
Folders are considered equal if they have identical names and paths.
Comparison is case-insensitive.
</p>

<p>There are two options how Drive Maps target conditions are converted to folder 
permissions in HTTP Commander. If you select the option "filter" in the import utility,
target conditions are converted to a <a href="#filter">filter</a> expression and assigned to 
the filter property of the folder. If you select the option "permission" in the import utility,
ACL of the folder is updated and the filter property is cleared. 
Users and groups missing in the Drive Maps target conditions
are removed from the list, and new users and groups are added to ACL with default permissions.
</p>

    </p>
</div>

<p>
In addition to manual importing of folders, you can automate this task with the
<b>gpoldrives.exe</b> utility. This utility accept the following parameters:
</p>
<p>
<b>gpoldrives [-fromDC &lt;DC&gt; | -fromFile &lt;fileIn&gt;] -to &lt;fileOut&gt; [-p]</b>,
</p>

<p>
where '-p' - a flag for copying user/groups conditions to the folder permissions list.
</p>

<!-- For windows version only. End --> 
 
 <h3 id="publicfolders">Public folders</h3>
<p>
    On this tab, you can manage (edit, delete) public links to files and folders created by users.
    You can also add new public links.
</p>

<h3 id="adminpermissions">Admin permissions</h3>
<p>
    You can specify which users/groups are allowed to manage settings, folders, accounts, localizations, 
    view event logs, errors, diagnostics.
</p>
<p>
    Also on this tab, you can add folders and specify them for users/groups who will be able to administer.
</p>

<h3 id="diagnostics">Diagnostics and License information</h3>

 <p>On the Admin panel, you can open the <b>Diagnostics page</b> (click the <b>Diagnostics</b> button in the toolbar)
 or view <b>license type</b> (click the <b>License information</b> button on the toolbar).

<h3 id="mailsettings">Mail settings</h3>
<p>The MailSettings group on the Settings tab in Admin Panel allows you to specify 
the settings of the SMTP server. These settings are used to send e-mails by HTTP Commander.
E-mails are sent by recover user password and send e-mail features. 
Users may send e-mails to share links to files and folders.</p>
